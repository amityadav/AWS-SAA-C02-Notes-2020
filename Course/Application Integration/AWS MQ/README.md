    * [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) - log, continously monitor, and retain Amazon MQ API calls
    * [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) - automate the process of creating, updating, and deleting message brokers

## When should I use Amazon MQ vs. Amazon SQS and SNS?
    Amazon MQ, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS are messaging services that are suitable for anyone from startups to enterprises
    
    If you're using messaging with existing applications, and want to move your messaging to the cloud quickly and easily, we recommend you consider Amazon MQ. It supports industry-standard APIs and protocols so you can switch from any standards-based message broker to Amazon MQ without rewriting the messaging code in your applications
    
    If you are building brand new applications in the cloud, we recommend you consider Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS. Amazon SQS and SNS are lightweight, fully managed message queue and topic services that scale almost infinitely and provide simple, easy-to-use APIs


## Message Broker
    Message brokers are an inter-application communication technology to help build a common integration mechanism to support cloud native, microservices-based, serverless and hybrid cloud architectures
