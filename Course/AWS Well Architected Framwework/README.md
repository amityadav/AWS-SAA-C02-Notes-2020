## The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

|Name | Description | Design Principles |
|-|-| - |
| Operational Excellence  | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.  | <ul style="width:300px"><li>Perform operation as code</li><li>Make frequent small reversible changes</li><li>Refine operation procedures frequently</li><li>Anticipate failures</li><li>Learn from all operational failures</ul> |
| Security | The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. | <ul><li>Implement a strong identity foundation</li><li>Enable traceability</li><li>Apply security at all layers</li><li>Automate security best practices</li><li>Protect data in transit and at rest</li><li>Keep people away from data</li><li>Prepare for security events</ul> |
| Reliability | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS. | <ul><li>Automatically recover from failure</li><li>Test recovery procedures</li><li>Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability</li><li>Stop guessing capacity</li><li>Manage change in automation</ul> |
| Performance Efficiency | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. | <ul><li>Democratize advanced technologies</li><li>Go global in minutes</li><li>Use serverless architectures</li><li>Experiment more often</li><li>Consider mechanical sympathy</ul> |
| Cost Optimization | The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. | <ul><li>Implement Cloud Financial Management</li><li>Adopt a consumption model</li><li>Measure overall efficiency</li><li>Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting</li><li>Analyze and attribute expenditure</ul> |

* Component - Code, config, AWS resource that together delivers against a requirement.
* Workload - A set of components that together delivers business value.
* Architecture - Is about how component work together in a workload. How components interact and communicates.
* Milestones - Mark key changes in the architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle.
* Technology Portfolio - Within an organization is a collection of workloads.
