# AWS Snowcone - Data Transfer
* AWS Snowcone is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing, edge storage, and data transfer devices, weighing in at 4.5 pounds (2.1 kg) with 8 terabytes of usable storage. 
* Its small form factor makes it a perfect fit for tight spaces or where portability is a necessity and network connectivity is unreliable
* You can execute compute applications at the edge, and you can ship the device with data to AWS for offline data transfer, or you can transfer data online with AWS DataSync from edge locations.
* Snowcone has multiple layers of security and encryption
* AWS Snowcone is currently available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Frankfurt) Regions.
