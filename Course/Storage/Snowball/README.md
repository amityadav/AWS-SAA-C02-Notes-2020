# [Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) - Data Transfer

* AWS Snowball, a part of the AWS Snow Family, is an edge computing, data migration, and edge storage device that comes in two options
    * **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized** devices provide both block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage, and 40 vCPUs. They are well suited for local storage and large scale-data transfer
    * **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized** devices provide 52 vCPUs, block and object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases like advanced machine learning and full motion video analysis in disconnected environments
* You can use these devices for data collection, machine learning and processing, and storage in environments with intermittent connectivity (like manufacturing, industrial, and transportation) or in extremely remote locations (like military or maritime operations) before shipping them back to AWS
* Snowball supports specific Amazon EC2 instance types and AWS Lambda functions, so you can develop and test in the AWS Cloud, then deploy applications on devices in remote locations to collect, pre-process, and ship the data to AWS

## Use Cases
* Data Migration
* data Tranport
* Image Collection
* IoT Sensor stream capture
* machine Learning
