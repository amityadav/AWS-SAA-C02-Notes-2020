# Backup
* AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that makes it easy and cost-effective for you to backup your application data across AWS services in the AWS Cloud, helping you meet your business and regulatory backup compliance requirements
* AWS Backup makes protecting your AWS storage volumes, databases, and file systems simple by providing a central place where you can configure and audit the AWS resources you want to backup, automate backup scheduling, set retention policies, and monitor all recent backup and restore activity
* AWS Backup provides a new, common way to manage backups across AWS services both in the AWS Cloud and on premises
* AWS Backup supports existing backup functionality provided by EBS, RDS, Amazon FSx, DynamoDB, and Storage Gateway
* To get started with AWS Backup, create a backup policy called a backup plan, which defines parameters such as how frequently to backup your resources and how long to store those backups
