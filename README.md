## My Certification Path

* I started with [Acloud Guru's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) - This gave me a good start and helped me understand basic concepts. The course itself is sufficient if you want to know about various AWS cloud constructs and fundamentals. But what i found is that this course itself will not be sufficient for you to pass the exam.
* The next thing i did was to start reading FAQ's for various AWS services (S3, EC2, CloudFront etc.), that gave me a lot of insights on these services and how do they integrate with other services, billing, performance, limitations etc. **This is very important as you will gain lot of insights which will definitely help you in the exam as you can relate to the scenarios and answer correctly.**
* Next steps or i should say in parallel to reading FAQ's i started watching AWS Reinvent videos from 2018-2019 which gave me further insights for these individual AWS services. Generally these videos are divided into level (100 - basic, 200, 300 etc.) so you cna start with basic level and move on to the deeper dive sessions. These videos helped me understand how these services are implemented in real world scenarios which helped a lot in my exam.
* Lastly i purchased questions on Udemy from [tutorialsdojo.com](tutorialsdojo.com) - [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Test](https://www.udemy.com/share/102DhfAEIfeF9QRHQ=/) this was very very helpful as the level of these questions are higher than what you will see in the real certification exam. You should definitely look at this.
